			"A multistage graph is a directed and weighted graph, in which all vertices are divided into stages, such that all the edges are only directed from the vertex of the current stage to the vertex of the next stage (i.e there is no edge between the vertex of the same stage and to the previous stage vertex). Both the first and last stage contains only one vertex called source and destination/sink respectively.",
